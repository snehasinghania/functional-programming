(* 
  The lexer begins by:
  - setting the current_token to None, since nothing has been detected so far.
  - lexeme to ""
  - input_string to ""
  - input to the input stream
  - scanners to FSAs corresponding to all the token types.

  Every iteration of the lexer consumes one character from the input stream.
  - All the FSAs in the scanners are exercised. Each of them will yield either of the following:
    * Proceed: The character is consumed and the next state is returned.
    * Terminate with failure: In this case, this FSA is removed from the scanners list for the next iteration.
    * Terminate with success.
  - The first of the FSAs which terminate with success is chosen to update the current_token and lexeme.

  The lexer must return if any of the following conditions arises:
  - The list of scanners becomes empty, i.e. all scanners have terminated.
  - The input becomes empty.
  In that case, if the current_token does have some token in it, this is returned. Otherwise, failure is reported.
